# HymnSelector

<p>As the ward music director, I was tired of selecting hymns by hand every week, 
so I came up with this little guy to do the job for me. It will ask for a number
of weeks and generate four hymns for each week without repeating hymns.</p>

<p>If you don't like the hymns it's selected, just click on the table cell and it'll
switch it out for you! Christmas and patriotic hymns have been excluded, and sacrament
hymns will always be within the sacrament hymn range.</p>

<p>Happy singing!</p>
